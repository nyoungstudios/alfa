# INTRODUCTION
#
# This is the Flutter and Dart telemetry reporting
# configuration file.
#
# Lines starting with a #" are documentation that
# the tools maintain automatically.
#
# All other lines are configuration lines. They have
# the form "name=value". If multiple lines contain
# the same configuration name with different values,
# the parser will default to a conservative value. 

# DISABLING TELEMETRY REPORTING
#
# To disable telemetry reporting, set "reporting" to
# the value "0" and to enable, set to "1":
reporting=0

# NOTIFICATIONS
#
# Each tool records when it last informed the user about
# analytics reporting and the privacy policy.
#
# The following tools have so far read this file:
#
#   dart-tools (Dart CLI developer tool)
#   devtools (DevTools debugging and performance tools)
#   flutter-tools (Flutter CLI developer tool)
#
# For each one, the file may contain a configuration line
# where the name is the code in the list above, e.g. "dart-tool",
# and the value is a date in the form YYYY-MM-DD, a comma, and
# a number representing the version of the message that was
# displayed.
