# Functions

The functions are located in the [functions](/functions/) folder and are the basis used to install a particular tool.

If you like to contribute a new entry with a function to install something, you can run this script `./tools/create_function.sh entry_name` from the repo's root directory to create the boilerplate code. For the guidelines and best practices for writing your function, please see the example [here](/functions/_example/).
